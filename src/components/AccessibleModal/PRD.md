# Modal Component PRD

## Overview
The Modal component is a dialog that appears on top of the main content, requiring user interaction before returning to the main content. It features full keyboard navigation, focus management, and screen reader support.

## Current Features
1. Keyboard accessibility with focus trapping
2. Proper ARIA attributes and roles
3. Focus management with return focus
4. Responsive design with animations
5. High contrast mode support
6. Reduced motion support

## User Stories
1. âœ… As a keyboard user, I can navigate the modal using only my keyboard
2. âœ… As a screen reader user, I understand the modal's purpose and structure
3. âœ… As a user with motor impairments, I have clear focus indicators
4. âœ… As a user with visual impairments, I have sufficient contrast
5. âœ… As a power user, I can dismiss the modal using Escape key

## Technical Requirements
