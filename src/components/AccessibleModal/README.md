# Exercise: Accessible Modal Dialog Component

## Requirements

- **Keyboard Navigation**: The modal must be fully navigable using the keyboard alone.
- **Focus Management**: Focus must move to the modal when it opens and return to the trigger element when it closes.
- **ARIA Roles and Properties**: The modal must incorporate appropriate ARIA roles and properties to convey its structure and state to assistive technologies.
- **Visual Feedback**: The modal must provide clear visual cues for focus states and active elements.

## Accessibility Details

We will be following the guidelines defined by [W3C Modal Dialog Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialog-modal/).

## Example Implementation

## Additional Considerations

- **Content Accessibility**: Ensure that the content within the modal is also accessible, with proper heading structure, image alt text, and other accessibility features.
- **Animation**: If you use animation to show/hide the modal, make sure it doesn't cause accessibility issues. Provide options to disable animations or adjust their speed.
- **Screen Reader Testing**: Test the modal with screen readers to ensure that the information is conveyed clearly and the interaction is smooth.
